# SmallGameProject
 
 This is a small project for the sake of practise.
 
"Story" of the game: You are a baby slime that has just spawned into the world deep underground. You must now find your way to the surface so you can show those pesky adventurers who's boss!

The game is a puzzle platformer where the player shrinks when taking damage and grows when eating food. Shrink too much and it's game over, however the player can only grow so big. Being large also makes it harder to move around, and food is limited, so eat too much and there won't be a way to gain health in a pinch.
